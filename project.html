                            bit challenging. But I enjoyed making it anyway. I learned that making somthing like this is
                            a bit time consuming and fun at the same time. I learned how to make a page and style it. At
                            the time I had some troubles with JS still do kinda.</p>

                            the riddle page and had fun making it. I finaly make an easy Js code on my own... With a
                            little hulp. I leared how to connet pages and make them interactable. I learned more about
                            Js and html and easier ways to work with css.</p>

                            challenging project I had tried to fix the code, rewrote the code and tried to find a code
                            that worked for others. And in the end it is a unfinished project. I might finish it
                            someday. What I did learn is how to make a better code and make it look more neater.</p>

                            make only a few lines of code. Looking back on it, I could have made it better. But I just
                            couldn't find a proper API I could Use.</p>

                            theme and it was fun seeing it come to live. I must confess my friend did do that harder
                            parts. What I learned this project is how Bootstrao works and how to make and start a
                            server.</p>
